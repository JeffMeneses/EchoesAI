# EchoesAI

**EchoesAI** is an immersive AI-powered chatbot where every conversation is part of a story.  
Instead of talking to a single assistant, you interact with a **cast of unique characters**, each with their own **personality, quirks, and backstory**.  

You won’t just be a spectator — **you’ll step into a role yourself**, taking on a persona with a mission to complete.  
Think of it as part **role-playing game**, part **interactive storytelling**, and part **AI conversation** — where every choice you make can shape the outcome.



## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI (API, DB, prompt handling, LLM)
- **Frontend:** React Native (chat interface styled like a messenger)
- **Database:** SQLite



## ✅ Features (so far)
- Create characters with custom greetings, tone, and quirks  
- Talk to them through FastAPI docs  



## 🛠️ Planned
- Messenger-style UI with bubbles, timestamps, and “thoughts” lines  
- Conversations saved to the database  
- Mood / trust meters that evolve based on interaction  
- Character selection with cards & avatars  
- Missions / quests for story-driven play  
- Multi-user support
